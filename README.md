## Ezequiel Arias van Lierde - Data Analyst
I am a medicine specialist in psychiatry and neuroscience, with a strong background in data analysis and management. 
Based in Mendoza, Argentina, I have been working in the public sector since 2010 and have progressively 
taken on management roles that have allowed me to work with data on a daily basis. 
In 2022, I decided to formally pursue a career in data analysis and completed several courses to gain the necessary skills. 
I also completed the Google Analytics course, which served as a great introduction to working in this field.

My background in medicine and public health has given me a unique perspective on working with data, 
and I am passionate about using data to improve healthcare outcomes and promote the overall well-being of individuals and communities. 
I consider myself a "white belt" in science, as I am always learning and seeking new knowledge and opportunities to grow and improve.

Currently, I am working on building a personal portfolio using data that I can share publicly.
This portfolio will serve as a showcase of my skills and a personal milestone tracker to motivate me to continue learning and improving.
